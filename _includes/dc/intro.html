  Python is rapidly emerging as the programming language of choice
  for data analysis in the weather, climate and ocean sciences.
  By consulting online tutorials and help pages,
  most researchers in this community are able to pick up the basic syntax
  and programming constructs (e.g. loops, lists and conditionals).
  This self-taught knowledge is sufficient to get work done, 
  but it often involves spending hours to do things that should take minutes, 
  reinventing a lot of wheels, and a nagging uncertainty at the end of it all 
  regarding the reliability and reproducibility of the results. 
  To help address these issues, this <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> workshop 
  will cover a suite of programming best practices that arenâ€™t so easy to glean 
  from a quick Google search.
